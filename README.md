## Assumptions

- A customer will always withdraw or deposit a positive amount

## Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### Bank Total balance

- Easiest to sum all customers money in the bank when a total is needed, rather than keeping count as each transaction is processed. This does have O(n) performance instead of O(1), but is simpler and less error prone.

- Keeping count as each transaction is processed sounds simple at first, it's simply another operation on `deposit` and `withdraw`, plus another piece of state on the bank class. However, you also need to consider adding new customers and deleting customers. Now the class needs a custom contructor to create it, and it's another thing to remember when deleting a customer. Finally should a transaction be missed for any reason, we would become out of sync.

- O(n) performance is acceptable as even if this "bank" had every person on earth with 10 accounts each, n would be around 70 billion, a process which can be completed in under 5 seconds by any modern computer, and less than 1 on my gaming computer :)

- This may no longer be acceptable were we IO or Network bound instead of CPU bound, how ever I've built this to the spec required without future-proofing.

### Classes vs Case Classes and Objects
- Used case classes and companion objects instead of classes, as that's more idiomatic scala.

### Either vs Option vs Try

Used `Either` as it lets us tell a user about what went wrong. Didn't use `Try` as I'm not used to it and it requires throwables, which I felt was too much work.

### Wrapping the Customers Balance in a Customer Class

- Not wrapping the customers balance in a class is simple and clean
- However, customer is highly likely to store information other than just a singular balance. Making it a class makes it extensible for that purpose.

### Using BigDecimal

Using `BigDecimal` is a nice way to represent money without overcomplicating things, one can generally avoid rounding errors without having to create a custom class that handles money precisely.
